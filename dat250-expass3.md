Main techical problem for this assignment, was that copy pasting the tutorial code into the cmd only worked 10% of the time for the longer database insert queries. Had to recopy and repaste a bunch of times, and eventually it worked.

I made a map reduce function that returns the latest date that each customer placed an order.  
How is this usefull? Probably to keep track of how long it has been since a given user used your service, maybe to auto delete old accounts or some similar function?
