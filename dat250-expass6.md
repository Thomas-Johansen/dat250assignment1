# Experiment 6

Had a few hickups doing this experiment. The main one being understanding exactly how to go about merging the Angular code with the preexisting Rest-API.  
A solid combination of reading the Angular tutorial page and asking Chat GPT if it had any idea what i was doing ended up with it working in the end.  
At a certain point, all the Angular/HTML part shold have been working, but nothing was showing on the localhost page, had to add some random imports in a Angular file, and suddenly everything worked, so alot of random trial and error.  
These weekly exercises vary vastly in the amount of time and headache they take to complete.
