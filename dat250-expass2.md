I encountered no mentionable trouble with installation and usage of JPA.  
My main annoyance with this assignment was viewing the database.   
I sat for two hours trying different ways to view it, but nothing seemed to work.  
The solution turned out to be in Intellij (Or Datagrip) to manually change the h2 driver to version 2.2.220.  
Then finally the database was viewable in intellij by using hte built in database viewer functionality.

Questions:  
 * Where is the database?
    The database is located in the DB.mv.db file in the main directory
 * What is the sql for the Customers table:  [customer](lab2/Customer.png)
 * Show database schema [database](lab2/database.png)  
I will say i was surprised when viewing the database schema, as there are alot of extra created tables compared to the classes we defined with java code.
